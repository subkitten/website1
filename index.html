            <ul>
                <li>Joined Riot Games in 2012 as soon as he got out of college</li>
                <li>August went through a few different gamertags over the years (groovylord, jinxylord) before settling
                    on his given name and becoming Riot August</li>
                <li>Has designed and developed champions such as Senna, Jhin, Jinx, and Zeri</li>
                <li>He's got a little habit of giving his champs 3-attack passives, so he gave Jhin a 4-attack passive
                </li>
                <li>A quote from August about Champion design and development in League of Legends: "One fun thing about
                    design is that there are different ways to approach it. I try to ask myself what the character is
                    like and how I want it to feel. For example, with Jinx I knew I wanted to do a crazy, very unstable
                    maniac. With Vi I was thinking of something more aggressive, punchy, that made you think that attack
                    is the best defense and with Senna it was about the artists who created her amazing weapon."</li>
